#
# Hidden Markov Model Regression (HMMR) for segmentation of time series
# with regime changes. The model assumes that the time series is
# governed by a sequence of hidden discrete regimes/states, where each
# regime/state has Gaussian regressors as observations.
# The model parameters are estimated by MLE via the EM algorithm
